# Refactoring test for GAP 

## Using Gilden Rose [repo](https://github.com/guyroyse/gilded-rose-javascript) as base 

This test consists in refactor all the existent code in ES5 to ES6+ using testing tools. My choice for testing tool will be [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

First, need to understand all the rules intended for this refactoring plus having a production ready code and coverage.
